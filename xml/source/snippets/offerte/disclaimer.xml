<p>It is possible that in the course of the penetration testing, ROS might hinder the 
operations of the Targets or cause damage to the Targets.
<c_short/> gives permission for this, to the extent that ROS does not act negligent or 
reckless. <c_short/> also warrants it has the authority to give such permission.</p>

<p>It is important to understand the limits of ROS' services. ROS does not (and cannot) give 
guarantees that something is secure. ROS, instead, has an obligation to make reasonable effort
s (in Dutch: “<i>inspanningsverplichting</i>”) to perform the agreed services.</p>

<p>ROS and <c_short/> agree to take reasonable measures to maintain the confidentiality of 
information and personal data they gain access to in the course of performing
 the penetration test within the Targets. Both parties will use the information and data 
 they receive or gain access to only for the purposes following from the agreement. 
 ROS warrants that all core-team members, external freelancers, and volunteers they engage 
 to perform the penetration test have signed a non-disclosure agreement. </p>
