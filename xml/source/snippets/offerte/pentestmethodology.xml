    <title>Pentest Methodology</title>
    <p>During the execution of penetration tests, Radically Open Security broadly follows the following steps:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Requirements Gathering and Scoping; </li>
                <li>Discovery;</li>
                <li> Validation;</li>
               <li>Information Collection;</li>
                <li>Threat and Vulnerability Analysis;</li>
                <li>Exploitation;</li>
                <li>Reporting;</li>
            </ol>
          

<p><b>Step 1: Requirements Gathering and Scoping</b> <br/>
In this step, the expectations of both parties are discussed and agreements are made regarding how to conduct the test(s). 
For example, contact details and the scope of the pentest are documented.</p>

<p><b>Step 2: Discovery</b><br/>
In this step, as much information as possible about the target organization and target objects is collected.
 This information is passively gathered, primarily from public sources.</p>

<p><b>Step 3: Validation</b><br/>
In this step, all customer-specified systems are cross-referenced with findings from the Discovery step
. We do this to ensure that discovered systems are legal property of the customer and to verify the scope with the customer.</p>

<p><b>Step 4: Information Collection</b><br/>
In this step, information from Step 2 is now used to actively collect information about the system. Activities conducted during this phase may include:
Determining which parts of the various components will be investigated;
Testing for the presence of known vulnerabilities, using automated tests;
Identifying the offered services and fingerprinting the software used for them.</p>

<p><b>Step 5: Threat and Vulnerability Analysis</b><br/>
In this step, potential threats and vulnerabilities are indexed, based upon the collected information.</p>

<p><b>Step 6: Exploitation</b><br/>
In this step, we attempt to use vulnerabilities of the various components. 
The diverse applications and components of the client's infrastructure will be relentlessly probed for frequently occurring design, configuration, and programming errors.</p>

<p>Note: Radically Open Security uses open-source scanning tools to get its bearings, but generally performs most of the exploitation by hand.</p>

<p><b>Step 7: Reporting</b><br/>
After finishing the audit, a report will be delivered where the step-by-step approach, results, and discovered vulnerabilities are described.
 The report and results will be presented to the responsible project leader or manager at the client's office.</p>

<p>Steps 4-6 may be repeated multiple times per test. For example, access may be acquired in an external system, which serves as a stepping-stone to the internal network. 
The internal network will then be explored in Steps 4 and 5, and exploited in Step 6.</p>
