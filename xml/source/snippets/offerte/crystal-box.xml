<!-- snippet --><p>Our penetration tests are run a bit like a Capture The Flag (CTF) competition: <ros_long/> has a geographically distributed team, and we use online infrastructure (IRC, git, etc..) to coordinate our work. <!-- snippet/template (choose) -->This is a blessing for <p_boxtype/> pentesting, as it enables us to invite the customer to send several technical people from their organization to join our pentest team on a volunteer basis! <!-- end of template -->Naturally, we extend this invitation to <c_short/> as well.</p>
