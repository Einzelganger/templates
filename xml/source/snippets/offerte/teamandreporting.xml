                <title>Team</title>
                <p>ROS may perform the activities with its core-team members, external freelancers,
                        and/or volunteers.</p>
                <p>First point of contact for this assignment shall be:</p>
                <ul>
                        <li><ros_poc1/> (<ros_short/>)</li>
                        <li><c_poc1/> (<c_short/>)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Our penetration tests are run a bit like a Capture The Flag (CTF) competition:
                        Radically Open Security has a geographically distributed team and we use
                        online infrastructure (IRC, git, etc.) to coordinate our work. This enables
                        us to invite the customer to send several technical people from their
                        organization to join our pentest team on a volunteer basis. Naturally, we
                        extend this invitation to <c_short/> as well.</p>
                <p>Throughout the course of the audit, we intend to actively brainstorm with
                        <c_short/> about both the pentest and the process. This is a continuous
                        learning experience for both us and you. Also, in our experience, a tight
                        feedback loop with the customer greatly improves both the quality and focus
                        of the engagement.</p>

                <title>Reporting</title>
                <p><ros_short/> will report to <c_short/> on the penetration test. This report will
                        include the steps it has taken during the test and the vulnerabilities it
                        has found. It will include recommendations but not comprehensive solutions
                        on how to address these vulnerabilities.</p>
                <p>A sample Pentest report can be found here</p>

<p>One of ROS's Core Principles is the Teach To Fish principle â€“ otherwise known as the 'Peek over our Shoulder' (PooS) principle. We strive to structure our services so they can also serve as a teaching or training opportunity for our customers.</p>
