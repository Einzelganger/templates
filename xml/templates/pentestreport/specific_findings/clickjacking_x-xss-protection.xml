<title>Missing X-XSS-Protection HTTP Header</title>

<description>
<p>The 'X-XSS-Protection' HTTP Header enables the Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) filter built into most recent web browsers. 
It is usually enabled by default anyway, so the role of this header is to re-enable the filter for this particular website if it was disabled by the user. 
This header is supported in IE 8 and in Chrome. The anti-XSS filter was added in Chrome 4.</p>
