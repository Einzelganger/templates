<!-- adapt and edit: impact + TARGET(S) -->
<p>Password reuse is generally a bad idea.
Once the password has been stolen, it may be used to log into other accounts, which enables the attacker to pivot and perform other attacks. 
In the worst case, an attacker could take control of the TARGET(S) and possibly other TARGET(S).</p>

<p>Strongly advise/educate your users not to reuse their passwords.</p>
