<title>Too Many Open Ports</title>

<description>
<!-- add: TARGET(S) and alter the impact  -->
<p>An unnecessarily large number of services is running on TARGET(S), enlarging the attack surface.</p>
</description>

<technicaldescription>
<!-- Either refer to nmap or other scans, or paste the command line and a list of open ports -->
<p>Our nmap scan revealed a large number of open ports and hence services running on the TARGET(S):</p>

<!-- edit or remove: command/SCAN OUTPUT -->
<pre>nmap -sS ... 
SCAN OUTPUT</pre>
</technicaldescription>

<impact>
<p>More open ports than necessary enlarge the attack surface. 
If we are able to exploit even one of these services, then we would be able to take over the TARGET(S) and comprise all of the services.</p>
</impact>

<recommendation>
<p>Set up separate virtual machines for the different services to separate the concerns.</p>
